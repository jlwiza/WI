ok were gonna start with broad strokes first

Because im thinking im gonna be going to a downhill section which means my natural discipline and curiousity will fail me
so i need to lock myself into a place to get this done and a prototype going

so first on the docket is getting filling working.. yeah i need that set up before i do this, there is gonna be a lot of noodling 

ok I think i got an idea for filling it should work i just make boxes and do flood fill , with boxes it should work just check if they are colliding with the split boxes if they are then we do some bounds checks with just the ones at that it collides with we creat the boxes and they become the bounds so they are always to the normal rights of the collision box when we paint it in

i also need to fix the bezier splitting code


but uhh yeah that is mostly it i just gotta make sure each piece by piece part of the thing works



second check the splitting, difficuly c+ pretty simple stuff a bit harder to check if its completely working though id probably have to test it by splitting a bezier then moving around some points

then check the biggun, after that implement your fill your prototype should first just do one that only fills the interior with a bunch missing

then we can get to work on storyboarding and all that fun stuff
